Marketing Campaign Effectiveness in the Banking Industry

In the banking industry, many finance companies seek to monopolize the client pool. Facing such a large amount of competition, the marketing and advertising strategies used are critical for banks to deliver value and capture the target audience. Companies spend a substantial amount of their budget towards marketing efforts which often times results in poor ROI. How can financial companies better allocate their funds and strategies to effectively reach the target market?  

Our team plans on analyzing data sets to view how effective or ineffective banks are in their marketing efforts. We will take a look at a timeless marketing effort that has been used, phone calls, to evaluate their approach and performance in persuading clients to subscribe to a product or service of theirs. Based on the analysis of the data and its different attributes, we can measure successes or failures of the current strategy, and reassess to recommend future campaigns that will deliver more profitable results.
